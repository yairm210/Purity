To publish the compiler plugin:
- Update version in `compiler-plugin/build.gradle.kts` 
- Update version in `java/de/jensklingenberg/gradle/HelloWorldGradleSubplugin.kt`
- `./gradlew :compiler-plugin:publishToMavenLocal`

To publish the gradle plugin:
- Update version in `gradle-plugin/build.gradle.kts`
- `./gradlew :gradle-plugin:build`


## Usage

* Inside the project folder run `./gradlew clean build` 

The plugin is only active when the build cache is changed. This is why you need to run "clean" before building, when you want to see the log output again.
